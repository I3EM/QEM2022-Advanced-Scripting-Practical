# Introduction

In this practical, we will be provided a processed mystery image and the code
that produced it. Our task will be to invert every processing in order to
uncover the hidden image, step-by-step.

By doing this, you will hopefully learn how to use DM Scripting to build a
scientific image processing pipeline, given that you know the mathematical
deformations the image has undergone. Of course, this practical can only cover
but a tiny part of the numerical processing field.

```admonish note
In case you get stuck, if you are short on time, or just want to look at a working
implementation of the algorithms we will program in this practical, for each task there
will be a *Proposed Implementation* subsection.

We invite you to make your own attempts before consulting them.
