# To Go Further

## References for DM Scripting

- Digital Micrograph's help section on *Scripting* covers the basics.
  A pretty good amount of example scripts are provided, and the *Reference*
  subsection gives an (unfortunately incomplete) list of the available functions
  (some described in the others subsections are not summarized there so try looking
  around).

- [Bernhard Schaffer's *How to script...*](http://digitalmicrograph-scripting.tavernmaker.de/HowToScript_index.htm)
  is a free (on-request) compendium of invaluable tutorials focused on solving basic
  and complex programming tasks.

- While not up to date, [the old Digital Micrograph's functions list](
    http://digitalmicrograph-scripting.tavernmaker.de/other%20resources/Old-DMHelp/AllFunctions.html
  ), also provided on Bernhard Schaffer's website, may prove to be useful.
